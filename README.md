# WDI5 Project 4 (NomniEats)

## Getting Started
1. Fork or clone this repo
2. In terminal: 
	* npm install
	* react-native run-ios

## Description
NomniEats is a iOS mobile app where you can search for recipes and convert the ingredients to specific diet restrictions (i.e vegetarian, gluten free, vegan). You can also save recipes for future use under your user profile.

## Technology
This project was built using React Native, Firebase, and the Edamam Recipe API.

## To be continued...
I would like to work on creating functionality within the app that would suggest beer or wine pairings for each recipe. I have done some research on whether an API exists, and am currently researching ways to build an API to serve this app.
